**What data-driven questions do we hope to answer about this domain and how?**

1. What height and weight classes for male and female athletes show the most success in different events?

  - We can look at max medal counts for different events and look at the categories that male and female athletes fall into.


2. How do countriesâ€™ GDP relate to their medal counts?

 - We can compare whether the countries GDP has an effect on their countries medal count.
 - We can also see whether an increase/decrease of the countries' GDP results has a direct relation with their medal counts for the Olympics.


3. How do the results of the 2021 Olympics for different countries compare to that of past Olympic games?

 - We can look at countries' number of COVID-19 cases and look at whether that affected the medal count.
 - We can also look at performance of the athletes from different countries based on the facilities the event requires.
